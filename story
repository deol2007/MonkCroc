Once upon a time in a forest, there lived a Monkey who recited on a berry tree, which was on the banks of a river.
In the same forest, there lived a Crocodial and his wife. 
One day the Crocodial came to the banks of the river, and rested under the tree.
The kind-hearted monhey offered him some fruits.
the Crocodialcame back the next day and foung my fruits.
As he days pass by, Crocodial and the monkey became good friends.
